# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started redesign of personal website to include responsiveness and flat design with more informative content and less clutter. Completed design mockup of entire website and began implementation of landing page.

**Thoughts:** I worked on the landing page (index.html) first. Still in progress so didn't commit changes to GitHub. Changing the website to use Bootstrap to be responsive. Also paying heavy attention to design. So I finished a mock design. Following the steps from Trello board that I organized into design, development, content, test, and ideas. Think I can put in more time though, definitely more than 1 hour a day.
