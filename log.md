# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started redesign of personal website to include responsiveness and flat design with more informative content and less clutter. Completed design mockup of entire website and began implementation of landing page.

**Thoughts:** I worked on the landing page (index.html) first. Still in progress ~~so didn't commit changes to GitHub~~ but committed changes to landing_page branch. Changing the website to use Bootstrap to be responsive. Also paying heavy attention to design. So I finished a mock design. Following the steps from Trello board that I organized into design, development, content, test, and ideas. Think I can put in more time though, definitely more than 1 hour a day.

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of landing and contact pages!

**Thoughts:** I continued my progress on the landing page and finished implementing both the landing and contact pages! I updated the content, removed unnecessary things like images and FontAwesome directory, changed the HTML, and updated CSS rules to implement a more simplistic, flat, responsive design. The design still needs some work - need to work on the buttons, links, and navbar.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of portfolio page! Also, organized all FCC projects into a repo.

**Thoughts:** I finished the portfolio page and made some minor changes to other parts of the website. Updated the README too. I moved all my FCC projects into a single [repo](https://github.com/nsivapalan/fcc-frontendprojects) and included a README on there. Next up for the website: JavaScript/jQuery effects, design changes to the navbar, links, and other parts.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed redesigning and rebuilding my entire personal website!

**Thoughts:** I finished the entire website, completing the design requirements and cleaning up the files by writing cleaner code. Still can be improved, though. I then tested the speed using Google's Page Insights tool, and then made some tweaks such as removing inline CSS and using `async` and `defer` for my JS scripts to avoid render-blocking. Learned a lot in the process of redesigning and rebuilding this website, definitely more than I thought I would for a website that uses mostly HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and very little JavaScript.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wikipedia Viewer project.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't make that much progress on the Wiki Viewer today. Struggling with the docs and how to use the API. My search is not working properly in that it refreshes the page as soon as I click search. Getting different results with different queries so I'm making some progress as to what I need to use with the API.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the Wikipedia API to <em>finally</em> work!

**Thoughts:** Although the search still needs to be fixed, I got the basic API working. I tested it with different inputs. After that, I got a basic layout done. Now need to clean up the JS, clean up the CSS and layout, and make sure everything works, of course.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of progress with layout and core functionality of WikiPedia Viewer is working.

**Thoughts:** I fixed up the layout issues I was having and got the search to successfully work. When you enter a term into the input and hit the search icon, the results successfully show up. Only improvement would be to get results without clicking icon but rather hitting enter. Included some nice CSS transitions to make the results stand out.

### Day 7: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Wikipedia Viewer project!

**Thoughts:** I added in some JS effects for the results, picked a color scheme, updated the layout (again), updated my portfolio with the project, and made sure everything worked across devices. On to the Twitch TV project!

### Day 8: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started on the Twitch TV API project. Got the API key and went through docs.

**Thoughts:** Although instructions say to use some other website instead of Twitch's official API, I went through the docs, and it was difficult to understand. So eventually, decided to use Twitch's official API and now going with that. Got my API registered and found out a way to hide the key, thanks to [this](https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25)! Will keep going through docs to get a comprehensive understanding of the API so I can play around with it and take advantage of all of its features and not just the ones required for the project.

### Day 9: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the Twitch TV API to work!

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of trial and error and reading through the docs and searching the web, but I finally was able to get the response I wanted by making the right request, printing to the console log. Next steps are to display that information on a basic layout and fulfill the user stories.

### Day 10: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Twitch streams and got live streams to show.

**Thoughts:** Got the basic layout done and displaying live streams. Next, need to show all streams, including ones that are not offline and ones that simply don't exist. Also, need to improve layout and JS code. Have to figure out a way to improve speed, keep code concise, and achieve the user stories. A challenge, for sure, one that I am looking forward to!

### Day 11: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got all channels to show.

**Thoughts:** Showing all channels (except inactive). Still need to do work with removing duplicates and showing inactive channels. Having a search bar would be nice too. Then work on layout and CSS and improve the code.

### Day 12: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved layout and fulfilled all user stories.

**Thoughts:** Fulfilled all the user stories - so I'm showing inactive channels and added in buttons to display the different types (online, offline, inactive, all). And I worked on the script but there's still duplicates that pop up and it doesn't work as expected. Weird but I'll have to dig deeper into the docs to fully understand what's going on "behind the scenes".

### Day 13: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Removed duplicates and using AJAX calls instead of getJSON. Also documented code and improved readability.

**Thoughts:** I was able to remove duplicates and redid the code to make sure everything came in order, using AJAX instead of getJSON. Overall, a lot of learning today, reading the docs, and improving the code. I should be able to finish up the project tomorrow with some styling and improving the speed.

### Day 14: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Twitch Streams project!

**Thoughts:** I improved the layout and UI/UX along with changing up the color scheme. I was thinking of spending another couple hours or so implementing a search feature or an "add your own user" feature where people enter a name of the user and it comes up with their status. But we'll see; for now, I think I'll move on to the FCC challenges.

### Day 15: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a calculator app and completed an FCC challenge.

**Thoughts:** I worked on a calculator app for a job app which was more complicated than expected. And completed 1 FCC challenge while reading up docs and articles on callbacks.

### Day 16: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC challenge and read up on docs on splicing and other Array functions.

**Thoughts:** The FCC challenge (Roman Numerals Converter) took me the whole hour to think about and devise a solution. I will get better over time. At least time well spent with taking the time to find a solution and read the docs, hence improving my learning process. Also updated website with some content.

### Day 17: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC challenge and read up on docs on Objects.

**Thoughts:** This FCC challenge, Wherefore art thou, taught me a lot of things on Objects like their methods and how to access properties and values. Code was ugly and inefficient though so will work on that.

### Day 18: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 FCC challenges and read up on docs on Arrays.

**Thoughts:** I was able to do 3 FCC challenges in under an hour, surprised but I guess some are harder than others. Also, I want to go back and find more efficient and neat solutions.

### Day 19: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 FCC challenges and read up on docs on Strings, learning new methods and properties.

**Thoughts:** Finished 2 FCC challenges, read up on docs. Always learning some new method or property that makes the solution a lot more neater and efficient.

### Day 20: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed an FCC challenge and learned how to use replace function with regex.

**Thoughts:** Finished an FCC challenge and got to work on a second. Learned how to use the replace function with Regex. Still learning about different regex combos.

### Day 21: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished an FCC challenge, learned more regex, and also documented code following good practices.

**Thoughts:** Finished an FCC challenge learning more regex patterns and how to use the replace function. Also documented code for past projects.

### Day 22: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC challenge and worked through different regex patterns. Also updated GitHub repos.

**Thoughts:** Worked on an FCC challenge (didn't finish it) and still working on it. Regex is tough but I'm starting to get the hang of it. Updated the GitHub repo for Tribute page with a README.
