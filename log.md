# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started redesign of personal website to include responsiveness and flat design with more informative content and less clutter. Completed design mockup of entire website and began implementation of landing page.

**Thoughts:** I worked on the landing page (index.html) first. Still in progress ~~so didn't commit changes to GitHub~~ but committed changes to landing_page branch. Changing the website to use Bootstrap to be responsive. Also paying heavy attention to design. So I finished a mock design. Following the steps from Trello board that I organized into design, development, content, test, and ideas. Think I can put in more time though, definitely more than 1 hour a day.

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of landing and contact pages!

**Thoughts:** I continued my progress on the landing page and finished implementing both the landing and contact pages! I updated the content, removed unnecessary things like images and FontAwesome directory, changed the HTML, and updated CSS rules to implement a more simplistic, flat, responsive design. The design still needs some work - need to work on the buttons, links, and navbar.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of portfolio page! Also, organized all FCC projects into a repo.

**Thoughts:** I finished the portfolio page and made some minor changes to other parts of the website. Updated the README too. I moved all my FCC projects into a single [repo](https://github.com/nsivapalan/fcc-frontendprojects) and included a README on there. Next up for the website: JavaScript/jQuery effects, design changes to the navbar, links, and other parts.
