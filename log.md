# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started redesign of personal website to include responsiveness and flat design with more informative content and less clutter. Completed design mockup of entire website and began implementation of landing page.

**Thoughts:** I worked on the landing page (index.html) first. Still in progress ~~so didn't commit changes to GitHub~~ but committed changes to landing_page branch. Changing the website to use Bootstrap to be responsive. Also paying heavy attention to design. So I finished a mock design. Following the steps from Trello board that I organized into design, development, content, test, and ideas. Think I can put in more time though, definitely more than 1 hour a day.
