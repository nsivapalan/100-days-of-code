# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started redesign of personal website to include responsiveness and flat design with more informative content and less clutter. Completed design mockup of entire website and began implementation of landing page.

**Thoughts:** I worked on the landing page (index.html) first. Still in progress ~~so didn't commit changes to GitHub~~ but committed changes to landing_page branch. Changing the website to use Bootstrap to be responsive. Also paying heavy attention to design. So I finished a mock design. Following the steps from Trello board that I organized into design, development, content, test, and ideas. Think I can put in more time though, definitely more than 1 hour a day.

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of landing and contact pages!

**Thoughts:** I continued my progress on the landing page and finished implementing both the landing and contact pages! I updated the content, removed unnecessary things like images and FontAwesome directory, changed the HTML, and updated CSS rules to implement a more simplistic, flat, responsive design. The design still needs some work - need to work on the buttons, links, and navbar.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed implementation of portfolio page! Also, organized all FCC projects into a repo.

**Thoughts:** I finished the portfolio page and made some minor changes to other parts of the website. Updated the README too. I moved all my FCC projects into a single [repo](https://github.com/nsivapalan/fcc-frontendprojects) and included a README on there. Next up for the website: JavaScript/jQuery effects, design changes to the navbar, links, and other parts.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed redesigning and rebuilding my entire personal website!

**Thoughts:** I finished the entire website, completing the design requirements and cleaning up the files by writing cleaner code. Still can be improved, though. I then tested the speed using Google's Page Insights tool, and then made some tweaks such as removing inline CSS and using `async` and `defer` for my JS scripts to avoid render-blocking. Learned a lot in the process of redesigning and rebuilding this website, definitely more than I thought I would for a website that uses mostly HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and very little JavaScript.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wikipedia Viewer project.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't make that much progress on the Wiki Viewer today. Struggling with the docs and how to use the API. My search is not working properly in that it refreshes the page as soon as I click search. Getting different results with different queries so I'm making some progress as to what I need to use with the API.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the Wikipedia API to <em>finally</em> work!

**Thoughts:** Although the search still needs to be fixed, I got the basic API working. I tested it with different inputs. After that, I got a basic layout done. Now need to clean up the JS, clean up the CSS and layout, and make sure everything works, of course.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of progress with layout and core functionality of WikiPedia Viewer is working.

**Thoughts:** I fixed up the layout issues I was having and got the search to successfully work. When you enter a term into the input and hit the search icon, the results successfully show up. Only improvement would be to get results without clicking icon but rather hitting enter. Included some nice CSS transitions to make the results stand out.
